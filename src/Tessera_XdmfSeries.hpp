// MeshSeries -- the caller-facing handle that turns N writeMesh() frames into
// ONE Paraview dataset with N timesteps.
//
// writeMesh() cannot know a series exists: it is handed a stem and a time, no
// frame index and no state between calls, and the caller invents the stems. So
// the only place in the system that knows which files form a sequence, and in
// what time order, is the caller -- which is why the grouping fix is a
// caller-held object rather than a change inside writeXdmf().
//
// MeshSeries accumulates one XdmfTimeStep per frame and REWRITES the master
// <masterStem>.xmf after every frame, so the master on disk always describes
// the frames that actually exist: a run killed at frame 40 leaves a master with
// 40 timesteps, not a missing or truncated file. The alternatives were both
// worse -- leaving the file unterminated until finalize leaves invalid XML that
// Paraview refuses outright, and writing the master only in a finalize call
// yields no master at all for a killed run, which is routine on long HPC runs.
// The cost is O(frames) rank-0 text per frame, immaterial against a collective
// HDF5 write.
//
// Per-frame .xmf sidecars are still written, so any single frame stays
// individually inspectable; the output directory holds N+1 openable .xmf files
// and the master is the one to open (it is the only one with no frame index in
// its name). The per-frame .h5 layout is unchanged, so readMesh() still reads
// any individual frame.

//! A time series of mesh frames sharing one master `.xmf`.
//!
//! Frame stems stay CALLER-OWNED: the master lists each frame's file
//! explicitly, so frame names need not be numeric or even ordered, and a
//! downstream caller keeps whatever naming it already uses. The one real
//! constraint that follows is enforced loudly rather than worked around: an
//! .xmf references its .h5 by BASENAME, so every frame must sit in the same
//! directory as the master, and write() throws otherwise.
//!
//! Usage:
//! \code
//!   Tessera::MeshSeries series( "out/bubble" );   // -> out/bubble.xmf
//!   for ( int step = 0; step < nsteps; ++step )
//!       series.write( mesh, "out/bubble_" + pad( step ), t );  // t increasing
//!   // open out/bubble.xmf in Paraview: one dataset, nsteps timesteps
