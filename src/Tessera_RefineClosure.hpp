// ============================================================================
// Transient red-green-blue closure (RefinementMode::Conforming)
// ============================================================================
//
// A conforming mesh is maintained as TWO layers:
//
//   RED layer      persistent, authoritative. Faces produced by red 1->4 splits
//                  only, 2:1 level-balanced. Exactly what the hanging-node
//                  refine() produces. Each red face carries its red Level.
//
//   CLOSURE layer  transient, derived. A green / blue / red retriangulation of
//                  every red face that has a hanging node on one of its edges,
//                  so the VISIBLE mesh (what mesh.faces(), the slices, I/O, and
//                  the geometry/stencil API see) has no T-junctions.
//
// The closure is recomputed from scratch on every refine call. It MUST be
// transient: repeatedly bisecting an already-bisected closure triangle degrades
// its shape without bound, whereas a from-scratch closure means every visible
// triangle is a red triangle or one of three fixed retriangulations of one --
// a bounded number of similarity classes regardless of refinement depth.
//
// THE KEY SIMPLIFICATION: closure creates no new vertices. A hanging node on a
// kept face's edge is a midpoint the NEIGHBOUR's red split already created, so
// closure only reconnects existing vertices. Hence no new vertex gids, no
// position/user-field interpolation, no RefinePolicy involvement, and un-closing
// discards no vertex state. Closure is also purely local to one red face, hence
// to one rank (a face is owned by exactly one rank) -- the functions below need
// no communication.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Closure patterns
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// For a red face with corners (a,b,c) and edges e[k] = (v[k], v[(k+1)%3]), let S
// be the subset of its edges that are bisected in the red layer, with midpoints
// m_ab, m_bc, m_ca. The 2:1 balance bounds the level jump to one, so a split edge
// contributes exactly ONE midpoint and |S| in {0,1,2,3}:
//
//   |S|  pattern       children                                            count
//   ---  ------------  --------------------------------------------------  -----
//    0   none          the face is emitted unchanged                         1
//    1   green         (a, m_ab, c), (m_ab, b, c)                            2
//    2   blue          (a, m_ab, c), (m_ab, b, m_bc), (m_ab, m_bc, c)        3
//    3   red-closure   (a,m_ab,m_ca) (b,m_bc,m_ab) (c,m_ca,m_bc) (mid,mid,mid) 4
//
// so a face with |S| split edges is replaced by |S| + 1 visible faces.
//
// Rules:
//   * Every closure child inherits the parent's Level and the parent's face user
//     fields. The closure never modifies the red layer -- in particular the
//     |S| = 3 red-closure does NOT increment Level and does NOT promote the face
//     into the red layer. That deliberately avoids a promotion cascade.
//   * Winding is preserved: the |S| = 1 and |S| = 2 patterns are written for a
//     rotated corner triple (A,B,C) = (v[k], v[k+1], v[k+2]), and a rotation of a
//     CCW triple is CCW, so every child is emitted in the parent's orientation
//     and faceNormalRaw / CurvatureCriterion keep a consistent outward normal.
//   * The blue pattern has TWO valid diagonals across the quad (A, q0, q1, C).
//     The tie-break is GEOMETRIC: take the SHORTER diagonal. That reduces to a
//     rule needing only the two split edges' lengths, never the diagonals' --
//     with q0 = (A+B)/2 and q1 = (B+C)/2,
//
//         |q0-C|^2 - |A-q1|^2 = (3/4) ( |C-B|^2 - |B-A|^2 ),
//
//     so "shorter diagonal" is exactly "connect the midpoint of the LONGER split
//     edge to its opposite corner". It is the standard blue rule and it also
//     gives the better-shaped children (test_conforming_quality measures it).
//
//     WHY LENGTHS ARE PASSED IN RATHER THAN COMPUTED HERE, and it is the whole
//     reason this rule took two attempts (Task 8 D6, Decision 11 in
//     tasks/conforming-refinement.md): the closure runs on the UN-CLOSED red
//     layer, whose corners come from closure children's ClosureParentVerts, and a
//     child may name a vertex gid its rank does not hold -- the documented risk
//     point 4. Those are PARENT corners, not neighbours, so a 1-deep halo does
//     not reach them either (instrumented at np2: one closeFaces() call asked for
//     12 positions the rank did not have, including original icosphere
//     vertices). Evaluating the rule from corner positions therefore aborts at
//     np >= 2. The length must be attached to the EDGE, not derived from the
//     corners: refine()'s Phase 2 already delivers each split edge's midpoint gid
//     from the midpoint owner -- which by construction holds both endpoints of
//     the edge it is bisecting -- to every co-sharer, so it carries the squared
//     length along in the same message (detail::KeyGid). Persistently split edges
//     never appear in that round trip and get their length locally, next to
//     recoverSplitEdges(), from the closure children's own corners.
//
//     Lengths must be BIT-IDENTICAL wherever computed or two ranks can pick
//     different diagonals and crack the mesh, so every producer goes through
//     edgeLen2Canonical() below.
//
//     WHAT THIS BUYS: the diagonal is a function of the mesh GEOMETRY alone, so
//     the visible layer is invariant under both a change of partition and a
//     change of RANK COUNT. The previous rule -- connect the lower-GID midpoint
//     -- was partition-independent but not rank-count independent, because
//     midpoint gids come from an MPI_Exscan and "agreed across the ranks of one
//     run" is not "the same value at a different rank count" (measured: the same
//     red mesh closed with a different blue diagonal on 4 of 20 blue parents at
//     np5, with np1-4 agreeing). test_conforming_determinism case A asserts the
//     invariance, and test_refine_closure drives both diagonals from geometry and
//     pins that RELABELLING the midpoint gids does not move one.
//
//     EXACT TIES are not hypothetical -- the icosphere is highly symmetric and
//     round 1 is the undisturbed icosphere -- so |B-A|^2 == |C-B|^2 falls back to
//     the old lower-midpoint-gid rule, which is deterministic and
//     partition-independent though still rank-count dependent. ClosureStats::
//     nBlueDiagTie counts how often that happens, so the residual dependence is
//     measured rather than assumed away.
//   * Face e[3] follows the existing convention e[k] = edge(v[k], v[(k+1)%3])
//     and is re-derived with the rest of the edge table by the caller.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Bookkeeping: every child stores its parent outright
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Un-closing must reconstruct the red parent from its children, so each closure
// child carries `ClosureParent` (the parent's gid) and `ClosureParentVerts` (the
// parent's three corner gids, in the parent's winding order) -- see
// ClosureFaceMembers in Tessera_Fields.hpp. Any SINGLE child therefore determines
// its parent with no sibling lookup, which is what lets migrate() move siblings
// without a correctness hazard (only a duplication one -- Task 5).
//
// A red face's gid is RETIRED while it is closed: it lives only in its children's
// ClosureParent field, and un-close reuses it. Closure children take fresh gids
// above the global max face gid, so a retired gid can never collide with a later

//!                     to skip the check.
//! \param firstNewVertexGid  lowest vertex gid created by this round's split.
//!                     Vertex gids are dense, so a vertex is new iff its gid is
//!                     at or above this. Only used for the `freshChild` check;
//!                     invalid_gid (the default) disables it.
//! \param len2Of       EdgeKey -> the WHOLE edge's squared length, from
//!                     edgeLen2Canonical(), for the same key set as
//!                     `midpointOf`. This is what the blue diagonal is chosen
//!                     from; see the header note on the tie-break for why the
//!                     length cannot be computed here from corner positions.
//!                     An entry is required only for a BLUE parent's two split
//!                     edges -- green and red-closure need no tie-break -- and a
//!                     missing one is a hard abort naming the edge, never a
//!                     silent fall-back to the gid rule. Defaulted empty so a

//!                     parent in a unit test) need not build it; any caller that

//!     outside {a,b,c} for which (x,m) and (m,y) are both edges of exactly ONE
//!     child. The one-child qualifier is essential: an edge shared by two
